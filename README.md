# Console Bookmarklet

This is a small console bookmarklet piping the output of console to a div.

To see an example and for installation see my testpage at gh-pages: [http://waxolunist.github.io/console-bookmarklet/](http://waxolunist.github.io/console-bookmarklet/).

# Why?

I had issues with the existing alternatives especially on my iPhone. So this console div is touch enabled.

# How to install

see [http://christian.sterzl.info/#blog/how-to-install-bookmarklets-in-ios](http://christian.sterzl.info/#blog/how-to-install-bookmarklets-in-ios)

# Issues

There will probably a lot of issues especially on sites using already jquery or jquery ui.
If you find bugs or issues plz let me know.

# Alternatives

* *[Jupiter JS Console](https://code.google.com/p/jupiter-javascript-console/)* 
  This bookmarklet didn't work for me.
* *[Firebug Lite](https://getfirebug.com/firebuglite)* 
  This is THE debugging bookmarklet. But on small screens and touch devices I had some problems and it was definitely overkill, for what I needed.
* *[Mobile Console](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/mobile-console)*
  I couldn't get that one to run.

# License

This is so simple I don't put a license on this code. You are free to fork and use.
